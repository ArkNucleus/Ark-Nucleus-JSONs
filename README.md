Looking for someone to make a custom DEATH NOTIFICATION mod. Basically everytime a player dies on the server, a notification pops on the top of the screen displaying the tribe and player's name with a sound like hunger games or something like that.

Looking for someone to make a custom "Tame Control" mod/panel/menu to config and change which dinos/creatures of the map are tameable or not on live server Basically a mod that allows admins via menu to block or enable the taming of certain dinos (existing ones on server, including mod ones). All this in real time and affecting the tamings on server without restarts.

Commissioning PRIVATE Modifications for Server Mod
Our team is looking to outsource the creation of a few elements, to be added to our server's core mod. Naturally, this means that the modifications themselves may not be posted publicly, and we will need access to the associated files to be added to our project. 

For ease of reaching different modders with different skills, I'm breaking the specific features up into individual sections, instead of one lump of features. Feel free to pick and choose which ones you're interested in when messaging!

Feature One: Race Menu
An extensive UI creation project, which will allow players to select their race, class, choose from key feature options, and edit the hue of their skin tones, hair, etc. A design document will be provided to interested modded, for accurate pricing.

Feature Two: Buff Adjustments
A set of pre-created buffs will be provided, with a few specific functions added to them. These are simple adjustments for the most part (capping player level, changing multipliers for certain statistics, adding a gamma effect, etc.) There are 14 buffs in total that need to be adjusted.

Feature Three: Server Lock
A simple INI addition, that will make it so that, unless the correct password is entered into the server's ini, the mod will be unusable (a simple blackscreen overlay, or something similar).

JOB: Decay Mod, this mod would add a functional decay for structures and dinos based on time.
The mod would have configurable features like:
Exception list for tribes and players to not be affected by the decay or config different time periods for them
Warn and Decay time
Instant Decay Command: feature for admins to delete structures with less than X structures (this could help with taming traps and others), also have the possibility to enter exceptions in this one for tribes and for certain structures.
